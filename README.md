Dirty Mike and the Bots

This lab deals with running a robot through a given maze using sensors and a wall following approach. The farther you get through the maze,
the more points you earn on the lab. Two libraries were used for this lab: Sensors and Motors. These libraries allow you to control your robot using the sensors and motors located on your robot.
My robot followed the left wall. This meant the following: moved towards the left wall if too far away, moved slightly away fromn the left wall if too close,and stoped if too close to a hall in front of the robot. 

PS. Dirt Mike and the Bots has the current maze record with a speed of 4.4 seconds. Booya
